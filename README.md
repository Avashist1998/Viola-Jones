# Viola-Jones_Algorithm
This is an implementation of the Viola-Jones Algorithm in python3. The results of the original algorithm are improved using Adaboost algorithm. 

The enviorment information 
Language = Python3
Packages 
numpy, open-cv, mathplotlib, os, joblib, multiprocessing and pandas

One can install these by using the following commands 
 numpy:   $ pip install numpy
 open-cv: $ pip install opencv-python
 mathplotlib: $ pip install mathplotlib
 multiprocessing: $ pip install multiprocessing
 joblib: $ pip install joblib
 os: $ pip install os
 pandas: $ pip install pandas 

One can use the sudo if having trouble or view the documentation online

# Operating system notes

If someone is running the code on a windows machine. They will have to change the path that is used in all of the file because the program was written a Unix based machine. The program makes used of parrellelization to decrease excecution time, so when running on single core machine on may observe 4 time the excecution time posted on the report.
